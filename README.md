# Genesis Studio — Eudaimonia System

**A concept-first creative lab shaping human-centered experiences across design, architecture, wellness, and narrative platforms.**

## 🌟 Our Mission
To transform initial sparks of ideas into fully-realized experiences — from story and concept to emotional logic and visual language — before design or execution begins.
